# Functionality

This add-on provides simultaneous active communication across multiple issues when editing a single primary issue. Many requests identified to have a central root cause, known as secondary issues, can therefore be closed when the primary issue is resolved. This cascading control of issues is made possible by this feature.

During ticket creation:

* Create a primary ticket
* Assign secondary tickets

When working on primary tickets, all secondary tickets will receive identical:

* Articles
* States
* Owner
* Responsibility

Bulk assignment of tickets to a primary ticket.

Two new dashboards widgets are available, to show the list of primary and secondary tickets.

2.) All additional created tickets are classified as secondary to a primary issue.
3.) The primary ticket controls all communication and ticket data for all related secondary tickets.

## Bulk Workflow

1.) Issues are created.
2.) The root cause is found, and a ticket becomes is made to the primary ticket..
3.) A bulk action is performed to assign all issues as secondary to a specific primary ticket.
